# 10X BCR VDJ Data Analysis Example
Objective: Illustrate examples of what type of analysis can be done on VDJ data to determine whether an antibody responds to a specific known antigen.

Rats are injected with a specific antigen to generate antibodies against. These B cells are subsequently purified before sent off to sequencing.
